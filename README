Designed, built and tested on Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty Narwhal)

To configure use cmake via cmake-curses-gui version 2.8 or later.

Best used in out of source builds.
Create a build directory outside the source tree
Then ccmake to the source directory.

Building:
	Extract the source to ~/cs6555/jrt/
	In the ~/cs6555/jrt/ directory 
		will see a folder named code containing folders[lab0, lab1,...]
	To build lab2 from the terminal in ~/cs6555/jrt/ directory
		cd ~/cs6555/jrt/
		mkdir build
		cd build
		mkdir lab4
		cd lab4
		ccmake ../../code/lab4
		make

Executing:
	The build will create several folders in the build directory
		Apps : contains the actual lab programs.  
			To run the submission for lab1 execute 
				~/cs6555/jrt/build/lab4/Apps/lab4
		UnitTest : contains testing programs to validate components.  Many examples here.
		
		UI: 	p key pauses sim
			a key tracks camera left
			d key tracks camera right
			w key dollys camera in
			s key dollys camera out
